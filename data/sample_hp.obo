comment: Multicystic kidney dysplasia is the result of abnormal fetal renal development in which the affected kidney is replaced by multiple cysts and has little or no residual function. The vast majority of multicystic kidneys are unilateral. Multicystic kidney can be diagnosed on prenatal ultrasound.

def: "The pattern in which a particular genetic trait or disorder is passed from one generation to the next." [HPO:probinson]
comment: While there is a close conceptual relationship between allelic requirement and inheritance, they serve different purposes; allelic requirement is necessary for variant annotation\npipelines and to determine if a given variant in a specific context is relevant to the phenotype of the patient e.g. a heterozygous variant (in the absence of compound heterozygosity) is relevant for dominant but not for recessive disease; while inheritance is used for describing the mode of inheritance of a phenotype and is particularly applicable in the clinical setting for communicating recurrence risk, to guide family screening, and to guide reproductive advice.

comment: Neurogenic bladder sphincter dysfunction (NBSD) can develop as a result of a lesion at any level in the nervous system, including the cerebral cortex, spinal cord, or peripheral nervous system. Neurologic conditions in children leading to neurogenic bladder dysfunction are predominantly congenital neural tube defects (including myelomeningocele, lipomeningocele, sacral agenesis, and occult lesions causing tethered cord). Acquired causes such as spinal cord tumors or trauma or sequelae of transverse myelitis are less frequent. Whereas from an etiologic standpoint neurogenic bladder dysfunction is a heterogeneous group, medical management will be similar irrespective of the underlying cause.

def: "Epispadias is a urogenital malformation characterized by the failure of the urethral tube to tubularize on the dorsal aspect. Unlike in hypospadias, where the meatus is on the ventral aspect, children with epispadias have a wide-open urethral plate on the dorsum. It is commonly seen as a component in the spectrum of bladder exstrophy-epispadias-complex. Isolated epispadias constitutes less than 10 percent of the total cases of epispadias." [HPO:probinson, PMID:23650202, PMID:33085327]
comment: Epispadias may be present in a phenotypic male, female, or an individual with ambiguous genitalia. A meatus in a phenotypic male may be positioned either on the glans (glandular or balanic epispadias), the shaft (penile epispadias) or at the attachment of the penis to the abdominal wall (penopubic epispadias). Alternatively, the urethra may be an open groove along the dorsal shaft of the penis, with no readily recognized meatus. Epispadias is a frequent component of Bladder exstrophy, but should be coded separately.

comment: The degree of variation of penis curvature is a continuum, but traditionally 30 degrees is considered the threshold for surgical intervention on chordee. Bowing usually becomes more obvious in an erect penis, but is frequently also palpable when stretching a flaccid penis. Chordee can be congenital or acquired; if the former, it can be associated with Webbed Penis or Hypospadias, which should be coded separately.

comment: A small scrotum is often accompanied by Cryptorchidism which should be coded separately. The size of the scrotum is dependent on the ambient temperature: a low temperature may cause the testes to retract, leading to the false impression of a small scrotum.

comment: Note that this term can include or combine variations in size and shape, with partial or complete absence of structures. It is preferable to describe the individual components, which are defined below. It is nonetheless a widely used bundled term and as such is retained here. The distinction of this finding from a marked degree of Hypospadias is an example of how this term can be problematic. Genetic gender is determined at fertilization, whereby the presence of a Y chromosome determines male gender. Normally, genetic gender determines gonadal gender which in turn determines phenotypic gender. Testicular development is an active process requiring expression of the primary testis determining gene SRY, which is located on the Y chromosome.

comment: Atrophic tubules must be distinguished from acute tubular injury as both can show extensive tubular epithelial changes. In acute tubular injury, tubules are often dilated and tubular basement membranes are smooth and maintain normal thickness, in contrast to the contracted tubules with thickened and wrinkled tubular basement membranes of tubular atrophy. Further, in acute tubular injury, tubules are usually back-to-back or mildly separated by interstitial edema, while in tubular atrophy tubules can be separated by interstitial fibrosis. Uniform thickening of tubular basement membranes without shrinkage and otherwise healthy epithelial cells can be seen in diabetic nephropathy. Duplication, or lamellation, thickening, and disruption of tubular basement membranes with tubular dilatation can be seen in medullary cystic kidney disease/nephronophthisis.

comment: Each human kidney contains approximately one million nephrons. The glomerulus is the most proximal component of the nephron. The glomerulus of the mammalian kidney is a highly developed vascular bed that acts as a filter, allowing a filtrate of small molecules, such as water, sugars, electrolytes and small proteins, to pass through a barrier that retains high molecular weight proteins and cells in the circulation.

comment: Glomerular changes can be focal (only in some glomeruli) or diffuse (in all or almost all the glomeruli), and segmental (only a part of the glomerulus) or global (the entire glomerulus). FSGS is characterized by focal and segmental occurrence of lesions with mesangial sclerosis, obliteration of glomerular capillaries with hyalinosis and intracapillary foam cells, formation of adhesions between the glomerular tuft and Bowman's capsule, and podocyte hypertrophy. FSGS is not a disease entity, but rather a pattern of injury with quite diverse clinical behavior, morphology, and possibly also pathogenesis.
